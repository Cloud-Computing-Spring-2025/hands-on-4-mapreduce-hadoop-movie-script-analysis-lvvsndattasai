RON: You need to sort out your priorities.
SNAPE: Always.
HAGRID: If anyone was looking for some stuff… then all they’d have to do would be to follow the spiders.

HERMIONE: It’s LeviOsa, not LevioSA!
SNAPE: Turn to page three hundred and ninety-four.
HARRY: I didn't put my name in the Goblet of Fire!
DUMBLEDORE: Harry, did you ask an older student to put it in for you?
RON: You're being stupid, Harry.
HERMIONE: You are a great wizard, Harry. You really are.
